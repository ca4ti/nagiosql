About Nagios
============
Nagios is a registered trademark of Ethan Galstad. - http://www.nagios.org


Version 2.00-P00
================

1. Requirements
2. Installation
3. Settings
4. Rights
5. Using

1. Requirements
   ============   

   - Web server (Apache 1.3.x/2.0.x)
   - PHP Version 4.1 or higher / 5.0 or higher
   - MySQL Version 4.0 or higher / 4.1 or higher / 5.0 or higher
   - Pear modul HTML_Template_IT Version 1.1 (http://pear.php.net)
   - Nagios Version 2.x (1.x is not supported)

   Pear modules can be normally installed with the following instruction automatically:
   # pear install HTML_Template_IT 

2. Installation
   ============

a. Unpack nagiosql-2.00-P00.tar.gz into your webserver's root, a subdirectory "nagiosQL"
   will be created:
   
   # cd /srv/www/htdocs/
   # cp nagiosql-2.00-P00.tar.gz /srv/www/htdocs/nagiosQL/
   # gunzip -c nagiosql-2.00-P00.tar.gz | tar xf -
   
b. Create the MySQL database - version nagiosQL_v2_db_mysql.sql is for all supported MySQL 
   versions..
   The Script creates automatically a new data base with the name db_nagiosql_v2, all tables 
   as well as the user "nagiosqlusr" with the password "nagiosqlpwd".

   # cd /srv/www/htdocs/nagiosQL/config
   # mysql -uroot -p < nagiosQL_v2_db_mysql.sql
   # Password: xxxx
   
   (Example for data base administrator "root" with password "xxxx"
   
   It is very important to set a new password for the user:
   
   # mysql -uroot -p
   # Password: xxxx
   mysql> use mysql;
   mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD("mypassword") WHERE User="nagiosqlusr";
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   mysql> exit
   #
   
c. Webserver settings
   The webserver directory for nagiosQL must be set up that .htaccess files are 
   read and interpreted.
   
   <Directory  /srv/www/htdocs/nagiosQL>
     AllowOverride All
   </Directory>
   
   Alternatively the settings of the file congig/.htaccess can also be written into the 
   server configuration. It is important, that the *.ini files cannot be shown with a 
   browser.
   
d. Configuration directories (Structure)
   The configuration directories must have the following structure:
   
   /etc/nagios/ 			-> Common configuration files
   	"     /hosts			-> Host configuration files
	"     /services			-> Service configuration files
	"     /backup/			-> Backups of the common configuration files
	"	 "   /hosts		-> Backups of the host configuration files
	"	 "   /services		-> Backups of the service configuration files
		
   The directory names are changeable but the structure must be kept!
   
e. Inside the configuration file of PHP for Apache (php.ini), the following parameter
   must be set like this:
   
   magic_quotes_gpc = On

3. Settings
   ========
   
   The application settings are made in the file config/settings.ini. The individual 
   values are described within this file.
   
a. The Nagios main configuration file must be adjusted as follows, whereby the main directory 
   does not have to be called /etc/nagios. The configuration files must be designated however 
   accordingly. Following settings fits on them supplied by settings.ini. 
   
   cfg_file=/etc/nagios/contactgroups.cfg
   cfg_file=/etc/nagios/contacts.cfg
   cfg_file=/etc/nagios/timeperiods.cfg 
   
   cfg_file=/etc/nagios/hostgroups.cfg
   cfg_file=/etc/nagios/servicegroups.cfg

   #cfg_file=/etc/nagios/servicedependencies.cfg
   #cfg_file=/etc/nagios/serviceescalations.cfg
   #cfg_file=/etc/nagios/hostdependencies.cfg
   #cfg_file=/etc/nagios/hostescalations.cfg
   #cfg_file=/etc/nagios/hostextinfo.cfg
   #cfg_file=/etc/nagios/serviceextinfo.cfg

   cfg_dir=/etc/nagios/hosts
   cfg_dir=/etc/nagios/services
   
   The lines started with # are optional.
   
4. Rights
   ======
   
   The following file rights are necessary - for example the web server runs by the 
   user "wwwrun" and the group "www" as well as Nagios runs by the user "nagios" and 
   the group "daemon". As configuration directory is used /etc/nagios:
   
   # chmod 6755 /etc/nagios
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios
   # chmod 6755 /etc/nagios/hosts
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/hosts
   # chmod 6755 /etc/nagios/services
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/services   
   
   # chmod 6755 /etc/nagios/backup
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/backup
   # chmod 6755 /etc/nagios/backup/hosts
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/backup/hosts
   # chmod 6755 /etc/nagios/backup/services
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/backup/services

   # chmod 644 /etc/nagios/*.cfg
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/*.cfg
   
   If these directories already have files inside:
   # chmod 644 /etc/nagios/hosts/*.cfg
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/hosts/*.cfg   
   # chmod 644 /etc/nagios/services/*.cfg
   # chown wwwrun.daemon /etc/nagios/services/*.cfg    

   Also the Nagios binary must be allowed to be execute by the web server user:
   
   # chown nagios.www /usr/sbin/nagios
   # chmod 750 /usr/sbin/nagios
   
   Last the web server user must be allowed to write to the Nagios commandfile:
   
   # chown nagios.www /usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd
   # chmod 660 /usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd
   
   (attention - the paths can be differently!)
   
5. Using
